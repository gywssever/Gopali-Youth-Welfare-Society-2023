Routinely interacting with unhygienic spots and sicknesses conveying articles, everyday life is harsh for them. Winter season can be considered extremely harsh for them as roaming and sleeping on the streets is very unsafe for wellbeing. A group of about 50 rag pickers has made their temporary stay close to our college. They have no one to call for help. To make them feel supported and assist them with enduring the colder time of year calmly, we are going to distribute warm clothes to them. So let's come together in this ordeal by joining our initiative. Donate as much as you wish. Help us spread your positivity and warmth to them.",
