              There is a natural law, a Divine law that obliges you and me to believe the sufferings of the distressed and the destitute. A service for the poor is a supreme virtue and the great channel through which the mercy of God is passed on to mankind.

              Our journey would not have been smooth if it was not for the support by the wholehearted participation and cooperation from the community as well as from the other partners (agencies) have helped a lot to sustain the activities.
