            Together, the Young Samaritans along with some Professors of IIT Kharagpur set on this journey and through the years GYWS has not just been instrumental in providing primary education to children at JVM, but has also undertaken different social initiatives to uplift the society! In Dada's own words <b>“GYWS is aiding social, economic and cultural development of weaker sections of society while encouraging people to seek solutions to their everyday problems within locally available resources!”</b>
